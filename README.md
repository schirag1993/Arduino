## A repository of various Arduino projects

Each folder consists of projects spanning various domains ranging from home automation to wireless arm simulation. The folders will also contain diagrams and instructions detailing the project construction and execution.

Everything here is **free to use**. I am yet to add the licenses but please feel free to explore, pull and tinker.

# Open Source FTW!
