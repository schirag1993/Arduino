## A repository of various Arduino projects

Each folder consists of projects spanning various domains ranging from home automation to wireless arm simulation. The folders will also contain diagrams and instructions detailing the project construction and execution.

Everything here is **free to use**. I am yet to add the licenses but please feel free to explore, pull and tinker. I have also attached the libraries that I have used. Some of the libraries have been modified to suit the requirements so it may not be exactly the same as the ones found on the official repository.

# Open Source FTW!
